# Caesar Cipher Programs Collection

A collection of Caesar Cipher implementations across various programming languages, created as part of a Theory of Programming Languages class project. This project explores language history, evolution, syntax, and grammar through practical implementation.

## Development Environment
Primary development was done in Visual Studio Code where possible. Some languages required online IDEs due to extension support limitations.

## Language Implementations & Run Commands

### Fortran
```bash
gfortran caesar.f95 -o caesar
./caesar
```

### COBOL
Due to VSCode extension limitations, this implementation uses the IDEONE COBOL IDE (browser-based).

### BASIC
Implementation uses the OneCompiler FreeBASIC IDE (browser-based) due to limited modern tool support.

### Pascal
```bash
fpc caesar.pas
./caesar
```

### Scala
```bash
scala caesar.scala
```

Note: For languages requiring online IDEs, the code is maintained in this repository but must be copied to the respective online environment for execution.
