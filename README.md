# Theory of Programming Languages Collection

A collection of work done as part of CMPT331 - Theory of Programming Languages

### Assignment 1 - Caesar Cipher
Implementations of a simple Caesar Cipher across various early programming languages. This project explores language history, evolution, syntax, and grammar through practical implementation.

## Development Environment
Primary development was done in Visual Studio Code where possible. Some languages required online IDEs due to extension support limitations.

## Language Implementations & Run Commands

### Assignment 1
#### Fortran
```bash
gfortran caesar.f95 -o caesar
./caesar
```

#### COBOL
Due to VSCode extension limitations, this implementation uses the IDEONE COBOL IDE (browser-based).

#### BASIC
Implementation uses the OneCompiler FreeBASIC IDE (browser-based) due to limited modern tool support.

#### Pascal
```bash
fpc caesar.pas
./caesar
```

#### Scala
```bash
scala caesar.scala
```


### Assignment 3
*Assignment 2 is lambda calculus work, which absolutely nobody wants to see :P*

#### Lisp
Run with Steel Bank Common Lisp and LISP VSCode extension

#### F#
```bash
cd CaesarCipher
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

#### Gleam
```bash
cd caesar
gleam run
```

#### JavaScript
... it's JavaScript ...

#### Scala
```bash
scala caesarFunc.scala
```



Note: For languages requiring online IDEs, the code is maintained in this repository but must be copied to the respective online environment for execution.
